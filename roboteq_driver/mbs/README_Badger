Notes for Testing the Badger MBS Script Using Roborun+
------------------------------------------------------

Once the script has been loaded, you need to be able to use the console to
set certain values to put the controller in a state that allows the user to
run the motor with the tools under the "Run" tab.  The following are important
to remember.

  1)  Restart the script after loading a new/modified version using the buttons
      provided on the "Scripting" tab.
  2)  On the "Console" tab.
      a.  !C 1:0
          This sets the encoder counter for motor 1 to zero.  You can test
          the encoder by turning the wheel one revolution after resetting
          to zero and checking the total count.  It should be equal to:
            count = GEAR_RATIO * (LINES_PER_REV * 4)
          The factor of 4 is because the Roboteq is using quadrature counting.
      b.  !C 2:0
          Same for motor two...
      c.  !VAR 1:0
          Sets motor 1 to mode zero, or velocity control
          !VAR 1:-1
          Sets motor 1 to the stopped mode (actually any negative value is ok)
          !VAR 1:1
          Sets motor 1 to position control mode (not tested)
          !VAR 2:x
          Same set of commands for motor 2
      d.  !CB 1:0
          Set motor 1 hall counter to zero
          !CB 2:0
          Set motor 2 hall counter to zero

          Again...after a full revolution of the wheel, this count should be
            hall_count = GEAR_RATIO * (4_POLE_PAIRS * 6_HALL_STATES)

      e.  You can read the value of any of the variables you set using a
          ? instead of an !.  You can also read the values back on the
          "Run" tab

3)  The Robteq+ seems to have some quirks.  Sometimes, it is necessary to
    shut it down and restart the program.  Especially if the USB was
    connected after the program was started.  Certain things like the ability
    to "join" the left and right motor with the checkbox under the "Run" tab
    seem to be missing.
